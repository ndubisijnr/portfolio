Hi, I'm Ndubuisi Jnr Ukonu ðŸ‘‹

I build frontend web and mobile applications for fin-techs and organisation offering SAAS solutions. I have gathered solid experience working with the most popular frontend frameworks in the industry. I have great expertise in bringing the simplicity of well-architected designs into developing scalable, complex applications with a wide range of knowledge in Banking and Travel. Iâ€™m proficient at developing apps based on customer specifications recommending application changes to make more efficient programs, and upgrading existing apps to make them more useful. I also have exposure with server side(backend) language like Django(python), Express js(node) and C. I am Fastinated about AI and Model language and hope that one day i will build something cool with it.
